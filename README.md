# FlatDark-Rg350-skin collection
I've decided to make a flat, windows 10 style skin for my personal use, but someone else may be interested in it. 
I'm not planning on theming every emulator icon out there since there's way too many, the settings and applications tab are the only tabs with custom flat icons. If I figure out how to skin more default apps the skin will be updated

Feel free to modify and add your own! This can be done by tinting imgs\bottombar.png, imgs\topbar.png and the background image + changing some hex colors in skin.conf
# Installation:

Copy the skin folders to /media/data/local/home/.gmenu2x/skins
